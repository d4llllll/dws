I will break down my logic behind why I only acquired bitcoin and sold the miners
 (once the era of GPU mining was over - when ASIC chips were developed -
 I immediately imported all ASIC units from overseas then sold at 
domestic market price (yielding exponential returns) - but I never actually mined myself.

Why?
 I liken crypto mining (and other potentially profitable, lesser 
explored discoveries) as nothing too different from the original 
American Gold Rush.

All
 the people with big dreams and hopeful hearts claimed their stake of 
lands and proceeded to backbreakingly dig for gold in the hopes of 
making it rich.

In reality, what did we observe?
 We observed that the proportion of individuals who risked it all just 
to come up empty-handed, older and poorer was extremely disproportionate
 to those who were lucky enough to actually make a living amount of 
money from the Gold Rush.

Who was consistently profiting the whole way?
 The General Store owners who sold these hopeful miners all the supplies
 and essentials they needed - albeit at a far inflated price (still 
market price), given the absurd demand to supply ratio that was created.

Hence,
 my philosophy I have and will continue to apply is one of focusing on 
finding and selling the proverbial shovels rather than entering an over 
saturated unlikely outcome.
